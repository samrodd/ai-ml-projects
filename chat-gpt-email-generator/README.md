This app will write an email for you based on up to two subjects you provide. 
It will address the email to the person you specify and you can select a tone to write the email with.

The app is built with Streamlit to render the front end components and OpenAI/ChatGPT to generate the email text. 

You'll need an OpenAI API key to run the code. 

When running the code in your local repository, make sure to run: 'python -m venv .venv' to setup a virtual environment
