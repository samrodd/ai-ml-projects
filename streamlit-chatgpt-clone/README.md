This code uses streamlit and OpenAI to create a ChatGPT clone.
The front end is built using streamlit components that render responses from the OpenAI API generated in the backend. 

You'll need an OpenAI API key to run the code. 

When running the code in your local repository, make sure to run: 'python -m venv .venv' to setup a virtual environment

To run the code, use the command "streamlit run chatgpt-clone.py"
